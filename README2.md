# Ames Housing Project

This project explores different regression models in order to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa.

## Modeling Process

I was given a training dataset of 2051 rows and 81 columns and a testing dataset with 878 rows and 80 columns. The objective of this project was to use the training datasets to build a model and then test that model against the testing datasets in order to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa.

The models tested in this project include a linear regression, ridge, and lasso model.
